* Sieve of Erathosthemes
*** By Feynman Liang <feynman.liang@gmail.com>
    This program generates a list of primes between 2 and a user
    specified n. Using the Sieve of Erathosthemes, a list of numbers
    between 2 and n is generated and then sequentially eliminated by
    testing divisability with smaller elements.
